# Search Algorithm Visualization
This application is a visualization tool for various search algorithms. Currently it supports DFS, BFS, and A* Search, but more algorithms are intended to be added.

This project began in 2019 during my junior year of college, and is still ongoing.

To run it, you can clone this repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

## Info
The green square is the starting space, and the red square is the ending space.

Click on one of the buttons above to start the visualization for different search algorithms.

Click on any square that isn't green or red to turn it black, indicating a wall.

Right click on any wall to remove it.

Click and drag on the green or red squares to move the starting or ending positions.
