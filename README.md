# Search Algorithm Visualization
This application is a visualization tool for various search algorithms. Currently it supports DFS, BFS, and A* Search, but more algorithms are intended to be added.

This project began in 2019 during my junior year of college, and is still ongoing.

To run it, you can clone this repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
