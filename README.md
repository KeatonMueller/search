# Search Algorithm Visualization

This application is a visualization tool for various search algorithms. Currently it supports DFS, BFS, and A\* Search.

This project began in 2019 during my junior year of college. I may add more search algorithms in the future, but I am not currently working on it.

To view it running, visit https://keatonmueller.github.io/search.

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

## Info

The green square is the starting space, and the red square is the ending space.

Click on one of the buttons above the grid to start the visualization for different search algorithms.

Click on an empty square to turn it black, indicating a wall.

Click on any wall to remove it.

Click and drag on the green or red squares to move them.
