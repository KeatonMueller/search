# Search Algorithm Visualization

This application is a visualization tool for various search algorithms. Currently it supports DFS, BFS, and A\* Search.

This project began in 2019 during my junior year of college. I refactored it in late 2020/early 2021 to remove React and p5.js so it's entirely HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

To view it running, visit https://keatonmueller.github.io/search.

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and open `index.html`.

Click on any wall to remove it.

Click and drag on the green or red squares to move them.

Hover or click on the arrows in the top left to reveal menu buttons.

Click on one of the search algorithm buttons to start its visualization.

Click on `Clear Search` to remove the visualized search, and `Clear All` to remove the visualized search as well as all walls.
